Description for the datasets used in the work
"Toward asynchronous EEG-based BCI: Detecting imagined words segments in continuous EEG signals"
published on "Biomedical Signal Processing and Control"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains the dataset used in the paper, this is, the instances with the features already extracted, and ready to be used in the classifiers.
The full dataset are stored in kaggle at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tonahdztoro/toward-asynchronous
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Each dataset Sn represents the instances for subject n, the number of subjects depends on the dataset used (1, 2, or 3)
- The datasets are saved in dictionary form for python reading
- Each file Sn contains the 4 folds used
- Each fold contains three keys ("TestEpochs", "TestTrials", and  "TrainTrials")
- TestEpoch is used for finding the onset and ending of the iamgined word for the evaluation of the F1 score
- TestTrials is a list of the 25% of the trials selected for testing the classifiers
- TrainTrials is a list of the 75% of the trials selected for training the classifiers in that fold
- Each trial contains the instances with the segments already split and the features already extracted
